# Extract Pages

This command is similar to [split](../core/split.md) with a default `span` of 1.

## Examples

Extract all pages from `book.pdf` into single page PDFs in the current directory:
```sh
$ pdfcpu extract -mode page book.pdf .
extracting pages from book.pdf into . ...
writing ./book_1.pdf ...
writing ./book_7.pdf ...
writing ./book_11.pdf ...
writing ./book_13.pdf ...
writing ./book_16.pdf ...
```

<br>

Extracting pages 5-10 from `book.pdf` into `out`:

```sh
$ pdfcpu extract -mode page -pages 5-10 book.pdf out
pageSelection: 5-10
extracting pages from book.pdf into out ...
writing out/book_6.pdf ...
writing out/book_7.pdf ...
