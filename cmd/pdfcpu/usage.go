         Eg: pdfcpu watermark add -mode pdf -- "watermark.pdf:2:3" "" in.pdf out.pdf ... multiwatermark starting with page 2 of watermark.pdf onto page 3 of in.pdf

   A watermark is the first content that gets rendered for a page.
   The visibility of the watermark depends on the transparency of all layers rendered on top.

There are several styles of booklet, depending on your page/input and sheet/output size, 
the edge along which your booklet will be bound,
and your preferred method for creating the booklet.

For assembly instructions for each type, see: https://pdfcpu.io/generate/booklet

n=2: This is the simplest case and the most common for those printing at home.
Two of your pages fit on one side of a sheet (eg statement on letter, A5 on A4)
Assemble by printing on both sides (odd pages on the front and even pages on the back) and folding down the middle.

n=4: Four of your pages fit on one side of a sheet (eg statement on ledger, A5 on A3, A6 on A4).

When printing 4-up, your booklet can be bound either along the long-edge (for portrait this is the left side of the paper, for landscape the top)
or the short-edge (for portrait this is the top of the paper, for landscape the left side). 
Using a different binding will change the ordering of the pages on the sheet. 
You can set long or short-edge with the 'binding' option.

In 4-up printing, the sets of pages on the bottom of the sheet are rotated so that the cut side of the
paper is on the bottom of the booklet for every page (for the default portrait, long-edge binding case.
Similar rotation logic applies for the other three orientations). 
Having the cut edge always on bottom makes for more uniform pages within the book and less work in trimming.

The btype=advanced is a special method for assembling, only for 4-up booklets.
Printers that are used to collating first and then cutting may prefer this method.

n=6: Six of your pages fit on one side of a sheet. This produces an unusual sized booklet. 

Only available for portrait, long-edge orientation.

n=8: Eight of your pages fit on one side of a sheet (eg A6 on A3).

Only available for portrait, long-edge orientation.

Perfect binding is a special type of booklet. The main difference is that the binding is glued into a spine,
meaning that the pages are cut along the binding and not folded as in the other forms of booklet.
This results in a different page ordering on the sheet than the other methods. If you intend to perfect bind your booklet,
use btype=perfectbound.

There is also an option to use signatures, a bookbinding method useful for books with higher page counts.
In this method of binding, you arrange your folios (sheets folded in half) in groups of 'foliosize'.
Each group is called a signature. You then stack the signatures together to form the book.
For example, you can bind your paper in groups of eight sheets (foliosize=8), so that each signature containing 32 pages of your book.
For such a multi folio booklet set 'multifolio:on' and 'foliosize', which defaults to 8.
The last signature may be shorter, e.g. for a booklet of 120 pages with signature size=16 (foliosize=4) will have 7 complete signatures and a final signature of only 8 pages.

box:

   A rectangular region in user space describing one of:

      media box:  boundaries of the physical medium on which the page is to be printed.
       crop box:  region to which the contents of the page shall be clipped (cropped) when displayed or printed.
      bleed box:  region to which the contents of the page shall be clipped when output in a production environment.
       trim box:  intended dimensions of the finished page after trimming.
        art box:  extent of the page’s meaningful content as intended by the page’s creator.
   
   Please refer to the PDF Specification 14.11.2 Page Boundaries for details.

   All values are in given display unit (po, in, mm, cm)

   General rules:
      The media box is mandatory and serves as default for the crop box and is its parent box.
      The crop box serves as default for art box, bleed box and trim box and is their parent box.

   Arbitrary rectangular region in user space:
      [0 10 200 150]       lower left corner at (0/10), upper right corner at (200/150)
                           or xmin:0 ymin:10 xmax:200 ymax:150

   Expressed as margins within parent box:
      "0.5 0.5 20 20"      absolute, top:.5 right:.5 bottom:20 left:20
      "0.5 0.5 .1 .1 abs"  absolute, top:.5 right:.5 bottom:.1 left:.1

      "-10"                absolute, top,right,bottom,left:-10 relative to parent box (for crop box the media box gets expanded)

   Anchored within parent box, use dim and optionally pos, off:
      "dim: 200 300 abs"                   centered, 200x300 display units

Supported usecases:

   1) Get a list of form fields:
         "pdfcpu form list in.pdf" returns a list of form fields of in.pdf.
         Each field is identified by its name and id.
   
   2) Remove some form fields:
         "pdfcpu form remove in.pdf middleName birthPlace" removes the the two fields "middleName" and "birthPlace".
         You may supply a mixed list of field ids and field names.
      
   3) Make some or all fields read-only:
         "pdfcpu form lock in.pdf dateOfBirth" turns the field "dateOfBirth" into read-only.
         "pdfcpu from lock in.pdf" makes the form read-only.
         You may supply a mixed list of field ids and field names.
   
   4) Make some or all read-only fields writeable:
         "pdfcpu form unlock in.pdf dateOfBirth" makes the field "dateOfBirth" writeable.
         "pdfcpu form unlock in.pdf" makes all fields of in.pdf writeable.
         You may supply a mixed list of field ids and field names.
   
   5) Clear some or all fields:
         "pdfcpu form reset in.pdf firstName lastName" resets the fields "firstName" and "lastName" to its default values.
         "pdfcpu form reset in.pdf" resets the whole form of in.pdf.
         You may supply a mixed list of field ids and field names.
       
   6) Export all form fields as preparation for form filling:
         "pdfcpu form export in.pdf" exports field data into a JSON structure written to in.json.
   
   7) Fill a form with data:
         a) Export your form into in.json and edit the field values.
         b) Optionally trim down each field to id or name and value(s).
         c) "pdfcpu form fill in.pdf in.json out.pdf" fills in.pdf with form data from in.json and writes the result to out.pdf.

   or

   8) Generate a sequence of filled instances of a form:
         a) Export your form to in.json and edit the field values.
            Extend the JSON Array containing the form by using copy & paste and edit the corresponding form data.
         b) Optionally trim down each field to id or name and value(s).
         c) "pdfcpu form multifill in.pdf in.json outDir" creates a separate PDF for each filled form instance in outDir.
      or
         a) Export your form to in.json.
         b) Create a CSV file holding form instance data where each CSV line corresponds to one form data tuple.
            The first line identifies fields via id or name from in.json.
         c) "pdfcpu form multifill in.pdf in.csv outDir" creates a separate PDF for each filled form instance in outDir.

   or

   9) Generate a sequence of filled instances of a form and merge output:
         a) Export your form to in.json and edit the field values.
            Extend the JSON Array containing the form by using copy & paste and edit the corresponding form data.
         b) Optionally trim down each field to id or name and value(s).
         c) "pdfcpu form multifill -m merge in.pdf in.json outDir" creates a single output PDF in outDir.
      or
         a) Export your form to in.json.
         b) Create a CSV file holding form instance data where each CSV line corresponds to one form data tuple.
            The first line identifies fields via id or name in in.json.
         c) "pdfcpu form multifill -m merge in.pdf in.csv outDir" creates a single output PDF in outDir.
